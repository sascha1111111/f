  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >Founded in 1995, Hannah Senesh is a K-8 Jewish community day school in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. We’re home to a diverse student body of 225 students who achieve their highest academic potential while developing a strong moral compass, social responsibility, and intellectual curiosity.

“Community” is more than just our name—it’s our identity. Students find a real sense of belonging here and thrive within and outside our walls. Our unique program combines educational excellence, Jewish values, and an inclusive and joyful environment. Senesh families proudly represent a wide range of Jewish backgrounds and reflect the multifaceted voices and perspectives of our ever-evolving Jewish community.

Together, we are united by our commitment to raising children who lead with a strong sense of self, a connection to community, and a drive to do good. We put our values into action in our classrooms and our larger Brooklyn community, teaching our students to be agents of change toward a more just world.   </p>
